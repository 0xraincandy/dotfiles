To install the dotfiles use this:

bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xraincandy/dotfiles/main/install.sh)

this will install the dotfiles, kitty, nemo, firefox, fastfetch, neofetch, sddm (with themes you can select), the grub theme from https://github.com/Hitori-Laura/myGrubThemes with my own picture and my wallpapers of cirno
